# Mohaimen-s-Christmas-Decorations---Arduino-with-Relay
Christmas house decoration by Mohaimen. Using Arduino with Relay

I hooked up a 16 channel Relay board with Arduino Uno
The pin layout were simple. The same as the arduino with an extension to the relay board.
I added a 12 V DC input to the Relay board as Arduino with 5V was not strong enough to support the board.
